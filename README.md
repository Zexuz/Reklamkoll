# Reklamkoll

This was my thesis in high school.
The full paper can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzSMVsg7bviLUGg1cFdVS2pTVHM/view?usp=sharing).(Itâ€™s in Swedish)

This project was a complete redoing of a the previously version on Reklamkoll that me and my friend worked on. 
The only thing this project had to go on was the idea behind the first version.
The code was written the summer of 2014, the thesis was written some month after that.
